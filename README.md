# CADDGroupProject
Ferris Wheel Project
Here is where we can put our parts and assemblies. Click "Releases" to find the assemblies.
Search the page for the word if neccesary. It doesn't really look like a link.

In the Issues tab, we can collaborate about which parts we need to change dimentions and shapes. If someone solves an issue, make sure that the issue is updated or deleted.

In the Pull Requests tab, we can upload our parts, briefly descibing what we changed in them.

Hopefully this helps. Thanks!
