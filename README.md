# CADDGroupProject
Ferris Wheel Project

Here is where we can put our parts and assemblies. Click "Releases" to find the assemblies.
Search the page for the word if neccesary. It doesn't really look like a link.

In the Issues tab, we can collaborate about which parts we need to change dimentions and shapes. If you are solving an issue and upload a part to fix it, please reply to the issue and mark it closed. It can be reopened if the fix does not work. If you notice that someone solved an issue without closing it, make sure we don't have extranious issues floating around. 

Hopefully this helps. Thanks!
